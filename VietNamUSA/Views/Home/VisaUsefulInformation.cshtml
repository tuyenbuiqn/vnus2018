                <p>You are recommended to apply for a business (not tourist) visa, especially if you will stay for more than one week.</p>
                <p>In this case, please send us a scan of the most important pages of your passport and the following information.</p>
                <p>After getting your data, we will ask the Immigration Department in Hanoi to issue a visa approval for you. Once we&rsquo;ll get it we will send by e-mail a scan of the visa approval to you. WITH THAT DOCUMENT you CAN go to Vietnamese consulate (indicated by you below) to ask for a visa. Usually you will get it very quickly (in some consulates even within an hour)</p>
